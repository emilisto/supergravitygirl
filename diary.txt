	Creating game in javascript. After creating a clone of the old classic Jezzball for windows (95?) in javascript i decided to do a plattformer.
 	
	About 5 h

 	I started out by creating some graphics just by happenstance when mocking around with a pixel art program. I created a little ninja dude (or girl)
 	and started to get excited on making a platform game. I decided to try this out in javascript since Im using it regurlarly on my job as a web developer.
 	If javascript proves to be too cumbersome I may reside to some other language like python, or C# or whatever!

	- After getting some basic understanding of how to implement a more modular approach in javascript i finally
		got started with the game. I created some objects, entity, movableentity and player for instance, where the sooner
		inherits from the former. However, going for classical inheritance in JS is not recommended (by some) so I will see
		if I will keep this inheritance chain. Probably I will go for the approved prototypal inheritance instead which basically means,
		building objects from other objects.

		After a couple of hours I finally got the player represented on the map as well as som crude ground and sky. The task of getting him
		to move was kind of simple (done that before), as well as him jumping. Thats were i left off.

	- Task: Look into a basic map editor
	Today : Downloaded Tiled, a free tiled based map editor that saves the map data as xml. Created a level according to some tutorial online.
			Read xml to JS-object
			* Struggled a bit with loading xml file, seems I cannot just load xml file from disk ( big security risk with that aproach), so 
			I need to install a simple web server next :). I will go for python, and install Simple web server, but that will be next time.

			Defined some tasks also as seen below
	- Tasks: 
		Create objects that represents:
		TileSet
		Tile ?
		Map (An object constisting of tilesets and layers etc)
		Layer (constising of Tiles)

		See ya.

2014-01-21: 2,5 h
	Install python and simple web server, got it to load xml file and got the values from it. Created TileSet and map. Need to create
		* layer
		* tile

	-	Try to render the map :)
		Plan to do next time_
			* Parse the layer info into layer objects. This objetcs holds tiles in certain order. The tiles specifies which part of a tileset image
			to show. Tiles are sorted from left to down.
2014-01-22: 2,5 h
	* Fixed layer and tiles objects and parsed them :), now its time to figure out how to render a map.
		- The map object can implement a render function which renders the tiles :D
			* OKEY, fixed the render function which draws all the tiles from a map, on a given position on the screen!

	Do next: 
		* Refactor the map file, maybe make it faster to run ?

		* Draw all layers

		* Add objects for collision detection
			- Maybe add enemy entity

2014-01-24:
	* Starting to add collision detection on the map tiles. Im roughly halfway through, 
2014-01-25
	* BIG UPDATE! COllistion detection works with map tiles and player ! Game draws all tiles and make sure certain tiles are solid for 
	player to collide on. This took waaay longer that it should have, mainly because of my stubbornness of trying to inventing the wheel
	all the time! It took my all saturday and halv sunday figure out that the solution was on sdltutorials.com, yepp the site I have done some
	tutorials on way in the past. But Im so glad this works now :). 
	Drew some ugly grass tiles and made a level, so the ninja dude(!) can jump a round and look cool now. Throwed in some stars just for the heck of it!

2014-01-26
	Small update: Today I started on a small animation object that will keep track on what frame of player to show. It
	will show correct image depending on what direction player is facing, if he's jumping, and also running. In the latter case
	a small running animmation will start, and the speed on the animation will correlate with the speed of the player (in direction x). Yea, 
	just like mario :).

	But today I only made a skeleton of the object (class?) but implemented at least that the player can face left and right now, which he couldn't before.

2014-01-27:
	Did drawing of plyer jumping as well as trying to get the player blinking while idle, That will require some more work to get it to work 
	nice in the game. Started code some ugly code anyhow. When player jumps it draws correct jumping symbol anyway! Thats goood..

2014-01-28:
	Spent 20 minutes writing down pseudo code getting player to frickin blink! :P . Got mad when loosing in Hearthstone and decided I could not go to bed before I got some game programming done.

2014-01-29:
	Player around with some movement variables. Not entirely happy with how she moves around. Need to fix that when shes jumping she 
	sometimes bounces of a roof to far away.	

2014-01-31:
	* Make simple animation loop  of players frame (DONE) ;)

	* Edge the player closer in Y-direction to walls, like if jumping, there should not be a gap between the head and roof when colliding	
		- Done, did a little hack, that player jumps closer to stuff now.

	* Made background scroll and made the map twice as large, 60 tiles width and 30  tiles height. But now the performance
		seems to have gone down. Is it to time consuming looping through all those tiles ? 
		Add restriction in render function in map object not to draw tiles that are outside the screen. 

2014-02-01
	Map performance tweaks!
		* Only draw tiles that are visible on screen!
		* Only render map, when it actuall has moved.

2014-02-06
	* Saw an interresting channel on youtube today, about making video games. Scoping! Make something small, thats actually playable
	from the start. So what I did, in this game was, make the player able to switch gravity pull. So now I have a prototype to make
	levels on. The only thing lacking is making deadly tiles, I will choose chainsaws for this prototype, and level progress! Clearing
	a level is like collecting something, i dunno, sheep for instance. So my goal is to make 10 levels that will introduce player to
	jumping, switching gravity, avoiding chainsaws. Yepp thats it! And then upload this shit for free on the internet. DONE! I will give
	it a week most. Thanks Extra credits, a youtube channel, and my work colleague who gave me the tip on this.

	* My next game, will be like a shooting range game, only you shoot wild life and stuff. 

2014-02-08
	* Made some spikes (to die on :)) and a door for reaching the next level. I got it rendering okay now. 

		- Make player die on spikes (Done)
		- When player dies restart level (Done)
		- When player reaches door and presses down, go to next level (or end game)
			* Make player sense door (DONE)
			* Restart game when walk into door DONE
			* Show next level when walk into door (DONE)

		- When player goes beyond map: die and restart DONE
		- Make 1- 10 levels (depending on how I feel)
			- Made level 1 DONE
			-Make level 2 DONE
		- Make some intro screen DONE	
		- When going to last door on last level, show finish screen! Yey!
		- Show help texts
			* Show how to jump (One level dedicated at this) DONE
			* Show how to switch gravity (one level dedicatied) DONE	
			* Show text when over door	DONE

		- Congratz! Your game is finished. Put the game online and forget that it existed :) (nah, just kidding, but Im kind of tired
		on this little ninja piece of shit right now)

		- Time to finish this, 1 week, next sunday (2014-02-15)

2014-02-11
	- Make player die on spikes (Done)
		- When player dies restart level (Done)
		- When player reaches door and presses down, go to next level (or end game)
			* Make player sense door (DONE)
			* Restart game when walk into door DONE
			* Show next level when walk into door (DONE)

	- Made three levels 
	- Today Annso tested the game for the first time. She sucked! But she improved alot on just a couple of tries!

2014-02-14
	- This saturday afternoon, Im at my work place grinding some gaming code :). Feels super nice to work with a big 27" screen for a change.
	- Fixed tutorial text for level 1 and 2. This is enough. Now the player can play on his own :)


	Okay, so basically its time to start making levels. BUT before that, I need to tweak some of the collision detection, player vs walls and player vs spikes.

	* Fix better col detection
		- PLayer vs tiles 
		- Player vs spikes

	* Create 8 more levels.
	* Create End screen	

2014-02-15
	- Added offsets for player vs tiles so that it more aligns to player sprite instead of a box bigger than the sprite. DONE
	- If player collides with spikes from the left and right, ignore death penalty, spikes should not hurt from side.
		Or better, add a little offset to spikes from the sides !

		* I added offset from the side for spikes. Now player can dodge them easier! :)
	
	Okay, so this is whats left...
	* Create 8 more levels.
	* Create End screen	

2014-03-01
	- Okay, time to start creating levels 
		1. Intro move and door
		2. Intro jump
		3. Intro gravity
		4. Intro spikes

	- Fix vertical offset on spikes. DONE good enough!
	- Fix better ground detection (Player can jump if standing next to wall) DONE
	- Fix end screen showing time and deaths of player!  DONE! Puh :)

	- More levels
		Yepp. Some levels are hard as hell though. And way to many moments on same levels. I need to split up a couple of levels into
		three or something. Then 11 will be like 15 levels. Nice!

2014-03-02
	- Started splitting some levels, this is fun!
